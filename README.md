# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Welcome to our machine learning group project focused on credit card fraud detection. 🚀 In this collaborative effort, we implemented various algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.

🔍 Key Findings:
Random Forest Accuracy: Demonstrated outstanding accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions.
SVC Precision: Led the pack in precision, ensuring a low rate of false positives.

💡 Project Highlights:
Utilized a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms.
Strengthened financial security by developing a robust fraud detection system.
